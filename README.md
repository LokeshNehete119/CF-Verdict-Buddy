CF Verdict Buddy uses **desktop notifications**.  
To make sure you receive them:

- ensure that **notifications are allowed** for your browser/OS  

Without notification permission, the extension **cannot alert you**.

🎵 Sound feedback is also built-in:

- 🟢 **Accepted** → success sound  
- 🔔 **Other verdicts** (WA / TLE / RE / CE) → different alert sound  

So even if you’re not looking at the screen,  
you can **hear** whether you got AC or not.
